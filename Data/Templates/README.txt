The templates folder should contain a preformatted "Outputs" folder with templated results. For instance, if an Excel report needs to be generated at the end of a process, such as a validation result, it should first be created in the templates folder with the necessary styles and Excel formulas. During the process, this template file should be copied to the "Outputs" folder, and the results should be written directly to it. Note: Excel files should not be created from scratch; all results Excel files should be based on predefined templates.
